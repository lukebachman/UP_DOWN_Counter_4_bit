# UP_DOWN_Counter_4_bit

• Designed an Up/Down Counter using Verilog to either count up to 9 or down to 0 and wrap around depending on the button being pressed.

• Developed a pause function to pause the counter when the switch is high and an asynchronous clear function to clear the counter to start from 0.

• Utilized a Clock Divider to slow down the system clock signal from 100MHz(10ns) down to 1Hz(1s) so the counter would count every second.

• Implemented Seven-Segment Display module to display numbers being counted

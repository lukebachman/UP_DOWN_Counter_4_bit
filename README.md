# UP_DOWN_Counter_4_bit
A verilog 4-bit counter that will count up to 9 or down to 0 depending on button press and wrap around. There is a pause function that will pause the counter and an asynchronous reset that will reset the counter.

• Designed an Up/Down Counter using Verilog to either count up to 9 or down to 0 and wrap around depending on the button being pressed.
• Developed a pause function to pause the counter when the switch is high and an asynchronous clear function to clear the counter to start from 0.
• Utilized a Clock Divider to slow down the system clock signal from 100MHz(10ns) down to 1Hz(1s) so the counter would count every second.
• Implemented Seven-Segment Display module to display numbers being counted
